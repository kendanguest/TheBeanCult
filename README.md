Welcome to the Bean Cult!

#### WHAT?
This is a fully fictitious universe that involves 8 characters as the main focus, all living on an imaginary planet named Astrylis VIII. These files and folders are a mix between both getting familiar with Obsidian for use of taking notes in school, and a product of my free time. I use Dataview as a way to help sort out lists of files like Audio Logs, but I mainly use the Graph feature to help sort out groups of files.

#### WHEN?
I've been working on this project since Mid-August, where I started out on my phone, before moving it to my computer in early September. These files was last updated on December 6th of 2024.

#### WHY?
I've always wanted to create. I never was able to express my imagination through Art or Sculpture of any kind, so I used writing as a catalyst to express myself. These 8 characters, although fully fictitious, are Original Characters (OCs) of 8 different real people, with each character being a result of one's own. Some events written are based on real story points between relations within this group of individuals, upscaled on a fantasy perspective, however most story-related media such as Audio Logs and Narratives are made up for the purpose of character building.

#### WHERE?
I suggest starting to explore through Pandora's Box. This folder has 5 files that can redirect you to specific yet notable points of interests within each folder.
##### [[Tape Player]]
A series of block quotes made from the perspective of each character. Most of the logs are written by me, but there are some logs that are written from the people who own the OC. These tapes reveal events that may have happened in a character's life or relations between characters and how they feel about one another.

##### [[Events Index]]
An index of an off-shoot story line that follows the 8 characters in a fantasy narrative. While some files are finished, most are a WIP that I have yet to finish writing. These stories are all written by me, with the plot, writing, and editing done by myself.

##### [[Character Statistics]]
A graph of an off-shoot video-game that follows these 8 characters. Said video-game does not exist, as I have not familiarized myself with game engines or animation, yet the numbers and values are balanced by myself. I asked the owners of each OC for input on minor gameplay impacts like underlying theme or play style, however each move-set in it's entirety is crafted by myself.

##### [[Artifact Collection]]
A list of artifacts that can be used by each character. This proceeds the off-shoot video-game, and is an add-on to the characters. Each Artifact buffs a character uniquely in different ways, but is balanced so that you may only equip 3 at a time. While one could argue I took ideas from neighboring games that are more upscaled, such as having relations to Destiny 2 or Genshin Impact, these artifacts are all made by me, tailored for specific characters locked to these notes, and have no such direct connections to these games.

##### [[Card Sleeves]]
A table of all of the cards used in Bean Cult: Battle. This off-shoot card game has yet to exist in real life, but is currently under production by one of the owner's of an OC, notably the person behind Loading's character. I am not the original creator of these cards, hence why most of the Action Cards remain unfinished, I am merely sorting these cards into a single system of files.
